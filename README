ovirt-host-deploy -- oVirt host deploy tool
===========================================

A tool to deploy ovirt hypervisor. Used by ovirt-engine when a new host
is deployed, and can be used manually.

USAGE
-----

ovirt-host-deploy [variables]

FILES
-----

Configuration file

    Default: /etc/ovirt-host-deploy.conf
    System Environment: OTOPI_CONFIG

    Config files to be read:
        @configFileName@
        @configFileName@.d/*.conf (sorted)

vdsm hooks

    vdsm hooks available at the following directory are copied to
    host during bootstrap.

     /usr/share/ovirt-host-deploy/plugins/ovirt-host-deploy/vdsmhooks/hooks.d/

    Packages can be installed using files at:

     /usr/share/ovirt-host-deploy/plugins/ovirt-host-deploy/vdsmhooks/packages.d/

    Each file contains a package per line.

    Files are selected based on their suffix, which should match distribution name.
    Distribution name is acquired using python's platform.linux_distribution().

DEVELOPMENT AND TEST
--------------------

FAKEQEMU

On the host, create:

/etc/ovirt-host-deploy.conf.d/50-fake.conf

  [environment:enforce]
  VDSM/checkVirtHardware=bool:False
  VDSM/configOverride=bool:False
  VDSM_CONFIG/fake_kvm_support=str:true

Install hooks manually or on the manager, create:

/usr/share/ovirt-host-deploy/plugins/ovirt-host-deploy/vdsmhooks/packages.d/fake.@DISTRIBUTION@

  vdsm-hook-faqemu

@DISTRIBUTION@ should be replaced with output of:

    python -c "import platform; print(platform.linux_distribution(full_distribution_name=0)[0])"

FAKEVMSTATS

On the host, create:

/etc/ovirt-host-deploy.conf.d/50-fakevmstats.conf

  [environment:enforce]
  VDSM/configOverride=bool:False
  VDSM_CONFIG/fake_vmstats_enable=str:true

Install hooks manually or on the manager, create:

/usr/share/ovirt-host-deploy/plugins/ovirt-host-deploy/vdsmhooks/packages.d/fakevmstats.@DISTRIBUTION@

  vdsm-hook-fakevmstats



OFFLINE

In order to avoid to try to use the package manager to install or update
packages on the host, create:
/etc/ovirt-host-deploy.conf.d/50-offline-packager.conf

  [environment:init]
  ODEPLOY/offlinePackager=bool:True
  PACKAGER/yumpackagerEnabled=bool:False



DEVELOPMENT

In order to avoid override of vdsm.conf, create:

/etc/ovirt-host-deploy.conf.d/50-development.conf
 [environment:enforce]
 VDSM/configOverride=bool:False
